# User Stories for Small Charity Fundraising Pipeline Tool

## ðŸ§± EPIC 0: Organisational Intelligence Hub (start here)

**Goal:** Set up your charity's story once â€” reuse it everywhere.

### User Stories:

- As a manager, I want to enter key facts about our charity (mission, registration number, contact details) so they're pre-filled when I apply for funding.

- As a manager, I want to describe our main areas of work, typical activities, and delivery models so I don't have to re-explain them each time.

- As a fundraiser, I want to list our outcomes, impact measures, and how we know our work makes a difference so I can easily drop this into bids.

- As a user, I want to describe each project (what it is, who it serves, how it helps) so I can reuse that info in applications and reports.

- As a user, I want to tag quotes, testimonials, case studies, and stats so I can reuse them in different funding contexts.

- As a user, I want to update key figures (like number of beneficiaries or project costs) once and have that update wherever they're reused.

ðŸ’¡ Think of this as building your "charity knowledge base" â€” structured and searchable, like Notion meets funding.

## ðŸ“¦ EPIC 1: Pipeline & Opportunity Management

**Goal:** Keep track of what you're applying for and where everything's at.

### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to add funding opportunities and assign them to specific projects from the Org Hub.

- As a user, I want to track which stage an application is at (e.g. researching, drafting, submitted, awarded, unsuccessful).

- As a user, I want to view a dashboard showing what I've applied for, what's pending, what we've won/lost, and what's next.

- As a manager, I want to track the total value of my pipeline so I can forecast income.

- As a user, I want to link deadlines (for applying, reporting, or reapplying) to my calendar so I never miss a key date.

## ðŸ§  EPIC 2: Application Drafting & Reuse

**Goal:** Speed up grant writing by using smart content, not blank documents.

### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to draft responses to funder questions using AI, pulling from my saved charity/project info.

- As a user, I want to select content blocks (e.g. "Who we help," "Outcomes") from the Org Hub to reuse in applications.

- As a user, I want to collaborate with my team on one live version of an application.

- As a user, I want to upload questions (from PDFs, Word, or web forms) so I can build my draft in the system.

- As a user, I want to track which content has been reused most often or worked well, to improve future bids.

## ðŸ“‹ EPIC 3: Task & Team Collaboration

**Goal:** Stay on top of who's doing what and what's due when.

### User Stories:

- As a manager, I want to assign tasks to team members (e.g. draft question 5, upload attachments) with deadlines.

- As a user, I want to see a personal to-do list of my assigned tasks across all applications.

- As a user, I want to view upcoming application/reporting deadlines across the team.

- As a user, I want to comment on a specific question or task for discussion.

- As a team, I want to work together on applications without duplicate documents or email confusion.

## ðŸ“Š EPIC 4: Reporting & Impact Tracking

**Goal:** Make reporting as easy as applying â€” reuse your data, don't rewrite it.

### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to track what was promised in an application (e.g. outputs, timeline, outcomes) so I can refer back later.

- As a project lead, I want to log delivery info (attendance, feedback, spend) during the project so I'm not scrambling at the reporting stage.

- As a user, I want to auto-generate a draft of a funder report based on logged activity and saved outcomes.

- As a user, I want to export impact data for internal use or other reporting formats (CSV, Word, PDF).

- As a manager, I want to see patterns over time in what's delivered and what's funded so I can improve strategy.

## ðŸ”Œ EPIC 5: Integration & Portability

**Goal:** Let people work the way they want â€” don't lock them in.

### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to export applications, budgets, and reports in standard formats (Word, PDF, CSV) for submission or offline editing.

- As a user, I want to integrate deadlines with Google/Outlook Calendar.

- As a user, I want to use AI tools or APIs (e.g. Notion, Slack, Trello, Salesforce) alongside this tool without friction.

- As a user, I want to import data from past spreadsheets or other grant trackers so I don't have to re-enter it all.
