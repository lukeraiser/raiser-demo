## Overview

This document outlines the development of a fundraising and funding connection tool specifically designed for small charities. The goal is to build a lightweight, intuitive system that enables fundraisers to track grant applications, manage deadlines, and gain insights into their fundraising performance. More importantly, this tool aims to simplify the funding process by creating a public-facing dashboard where charities can invite discussions and build relationships with funders, reducing reliance on traditional application processes. The system will also introduce "One Grant Application To Rule Them All"â€”a streamlined, universal grant application that funders can interact with directly, cutting down on redundant application processes.

## Target Users

- Fundraisers at small charities
- Charity leaders managing grant applications
- Consultants supporting multiple charities
- Funders seeking charities to support

## Key Goals

- Centralized tracking of all grant applications.
- Pipeline insights to help fundraisers measure success.
- Task and deadline management to ensure no opportunity is missed.
- Reporting & financial integration to support budgeting decisions.
- Simple, intuitive UI that non-technical users can navigate easily.
- Public dashboard for charities to showcase needs and connect with funders directly.
- "One Grant Application To Rule Them All"â€”a single, reusable application profile funders can browse.
- Reduce the need for lengthy traditional application processes by fostering direct engagement.
- Future integrations with existing charity systems (e.g., Salesforce, Xero).
